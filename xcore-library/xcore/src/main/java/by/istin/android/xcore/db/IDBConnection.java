     *                      data from storage that isn't going to be used.
     * @param selection     A filter declaring which rows to return, formatted as an
     *                      SQL WHERE clause (excluding the WHERE itself). Passing null
     *                      will return all rows for the given table.

     *                      (excluding the ORDER BY itself). Passing null will use the
     *                      default sort order, which may be unordered.
     * @param limit         Limits the number of rows returned by the query,
     *                      formatted as LIMIT clause. Passing null denotes no LIMIT clause.
